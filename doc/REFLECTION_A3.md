S – Situation:
“In one of my projects, I built a Magical Story Generator for kids. I had volunteered at a summer camp the year before, and I noticed how much the kids loved making up their own stories. That gave me the idea to build something they could actually interact with.”
T – Task:
“My goal was to take a large collection of stories and organize the data so the program could create new, fun ones that kids would enjoy.”
A – Action:
“I cleaned up the text, broke it into parts like characters, settings, and magical objects, and added features that let the tone of the story shift — for example, making it happy, silly, or adventurous. Then I built the generator so the kids could give a few ideas, and the app would create unique stories around them.”
R – Result:
“The project worked really well — it generated fun, kid-friendly stories, and when I shared the idea with some of the camp kids, they loved it. It showed me how data and creativity can come together to make something that really engages people.”
