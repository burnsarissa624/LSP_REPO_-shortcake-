My compiler says “cannot find symbol setConnected(boolean).” What should I do?

ChatGPT:
Ensure the method in Device.java is declared as:
protected void setConnected(boolean connected) {
    this.connected = connected;
}
Then subclasses can safely call it from connect() and disconnect().

What should DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera each extend or implement?

ChatGPT:
• DoorLock – extends Device, implements Networked and BatteryPowered  
• Thermostat – extends Device, implements Networked  
• Camera – extends Device, implements Networked and BatteryPowered

All constructors must call super(id, location) and validate inputs.

Use a setter that checks bounds:
